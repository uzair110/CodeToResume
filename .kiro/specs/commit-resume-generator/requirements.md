# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Commit Resume Generator is an application that analyzes a developer's Git commit history and code changes to automatically generate professional resume bullet points. The system will fetch commits from a specified repository, analyze the code changes to understand the technical work performed, and convert these insights into action-oriented bullet points suitable for a resume. Each bullet point will follow professional resume formatting standards, starting with an action verb and clearly articulating both the action taken and its impact.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub and select from my available repositories, so that I can easily choose which repository to analyze for resume generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides GitHub authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL securely store and use them for API access
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the user's available repositories
3. WHEN displaying repositories THEN the system SHALL show both public and private repositories the user has access to
4. WHEN a user selects a repository THEN the system SHALL validate the repository accessibility and confirm the selection
5. WHEN repository selection is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready to fetch commits from the chosen repository

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fetch and filter my commits from a specific time period, so that I can focus on relevant work experience for my resume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a date range THEN the system SHALL fetch only commits within that timeframe
2. WHEN a user specifies an author filter THEN the system SHALL fetch only commits by that author
3. WHEN commits are fetched THEN the system SHALL retrieve commit metadata including message, timestamp, files changed, and diff data
4. IF no commits are found in the specified criteria THEN the system SHALL notify the user with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze my code changes intelligently, so that it can understand the technical work I performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL identify programming languages used in the changes
2. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL detect types of changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, performance improvements)
3. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL identify frameworks, libraries, and technologies involved
4. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL quantify the scope of changes (lines added/removed, files modified)
5. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL filter out trivial changes (log removals, simple renaming, whitespace changes, minor formatting)
6. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL ignore commits with minimal impact or non-substantive changes
7. WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL group related commits by feature or project area

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate professional resume bullet points, so that I can easily add them to my resume without manual formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating bullet points THEN each bullet point SHALL start with a strong action verb
2. WHEN generating bullet points THEN each bullet point SHALL include both the action performed and its impact or result
3. WHEN generating bullet points THEN the system SHALL use professional, quantifiable language where possible
4. WHEN generating bullet points THEN the system SHALL avoid technical jargon that non-technical recruiters wouldn't understand
5. WHEN generating bullet points THEN the system SHALL limit each bullet point to 1-2 lines for resume formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and customize the generated bullet points, so that I can ensure they accurately represent my work and fit my resume style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bullet points are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in an editable format
2. WHEN a user edits a bullet point THEN the system SHALL save the changes
3. WHEN a user wants to regenerate a bullet point THEN the system SHALL provide alternative versions
4. WHEN a user is satisfied with bullet points THEN the system SHALL provide export options (text, markdown, or formatted document)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository access fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms with user notification
3. WHEN commit analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other commits
4. WHEN no meaningful bullet points can be generated THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my data to be handled securely, so that my code and repository information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt them securely
2. WHEN processing code content THEN the system SHALL not store sensitive code permanently
3. WHEN generating bullet points THEN the system SHALL not include sensitive information like API keys or passwords
4. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL clear temporary data appropriately
